## Nucleus Force Map

Nucleus Force Map calculates the directional forces exerted on a cell nucleus by microtubules. By analyzing the geometry
and position of the molecules within the cell, the program predicts the net force vectors that determine the nucleus'
movement and positioning within the cell.
